Design Process:
Planning
Prior to building, the team determined our concept by brainstorming ideas.  We then hashed out the concept further by asking if it has real world relevance, what makes it different from other websites and apps and determined the different team interests and skill sets to ensure project success.
+Research
+Team members began research various API's for Geolocation, climate change, weather, endangered animals etc.  We reviewed the documentation to determine ease of use and whether or not it met the project requirements and needs
The UI/UX designer researched multiple different CSS frameworks to determine the one with varied colors and flexibility that was desired for this site.  Exploration, researching and tutorials and testing were done for Foundation, Materialize, Pure, Bulma, and Semantic
Build
All coding work was done concurrently.  The UI/UX design was initiated as soon as the planning phase was completed as it had other code dependencies.  Meanwhile, the API, Firebase/Forms code work was also being developed.  The team then came together and began merging files to compile the code and test the finaL site.
Testing/QA
Each individual Developer did initial testing on individual parts of code prior to merging it into the overall site master.  Then once uploaded, additional testing and review was executed on the site overall to ensure everything was functioning correctly and efficiently.
Implementation
Upon completeion of testing, the site was implemented via GitHub Pages: https://atmos-project1.github.io/ATMOS/
